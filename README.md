# AI-Powered API Gateway

## Description
This project implements an AI-powered API gateway using Azure API Management, OpenAI, and Python. It analyzes and filters incoming API requests for security threats, rate limiting, and content moderation using AI models. The gateway dynamically enforces policies based on natural language processing (NLP) and predictive analytics.

## Features
- AI-based threat detection and filtering
- Dynamic rate limiting and content moderation
- Integration with Azure OpenAI for NLP
- Scalable and secure API gateway architecture

## Branches
- main: Stable production-ready code
- dev: Active development and feature integration
- ai-enhancements: Experimental AI model improvements

## Getting Started
1. Clone the repository
2. Set up Azure API Management and OpenAI credentials
3. Run the Python scripts for request analysis
4. Deploy the gateway on Azure
